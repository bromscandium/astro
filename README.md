# Astro Game Project

## Overview
Astro Game is a simple game project written in C. It is structured with multiple source files and headers to ensure modular and maintainable code. The project appears to feature various game components, such as game levels, menus, and a shop system.

## Features
- Modular code design with separate files for game logic, levels, menu handling, and shop management.
- Well-organized project structure for ease of development and maintenance.
- Saving element for further playing.
- Use of `Makefile` for simple and efficient compilation.

## File Structure
```
astro/
├── Makefile          # Build system configuration
├── game.c            # Core game logic
├── game.h            # Game logic header
├── levels.c          # Level management logic
├── levels.h          # Level management header
├── main.c            # Entry point of the program, automatically creates settings.txt
├── main.h            # Main program header
├── menu.c            # Menu handling logic
├── menu.h            # Menu header
├── shop.c            # Shop system logic
└── shop.h            # Shop system header
```

## Build Instructions
To compile the project, ensure that you have `make` and a compatible C compiler installed (such as `gcc`). Then, simply run:

```bash
make all
```

This will generate the executable file as specified in the `Makefile`.

### Cleaning Up
To clean up compiled files, use:

```bash
make clean
```

## How to Run
After compiling the project, run the executable generated by the build process:

```bash
./astro
```

## Dependencies
The project requires:
- GCC (or any standard C compiler)
- Make
